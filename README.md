# Purpose
This project was developed to implement and test a low access query system from a 
simulated distributed-coded storage system. This system is then implemented in a quantized
logistic regression algorithm. The project is based on this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06101).

This Repository was developed by:

- **Willem Strydom**
- **Jinzhao Kang**

# Usage notes
Project is entirely python. Requires numpy, and pandas to work.
Matplotlib is used for plotting sometimes.

# to do...
do a run of the test alg, but add back the func to record the access node by node, 
so that we can make plots and stuff.
